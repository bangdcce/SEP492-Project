ID
Rule Definition
BR-01
All user input data must be validated for correctness before processing
BR-02
User email must be unique
BR-03
User password must be
BR-04
The Client must answer all required questions in the Guided Input Wizard before a request can be created. Incomplete specs cannot be posted.
BR-05
If "Post to Market" is selected, the request is visible to all Freelancers on the "Public Request" board.

If "Find and Invite" is selected, the request is hidden from the public board and is only viewable by freelancers specifically invited by the Client or matched by the System.
BR-06
The text input fields in the wizard must pass a content filter to ensure no prohibited content is posted.
BR-07
When the user create project from request, the visibility of project is private and cannot be changed
BR-08
The Client must only see Requests created by their own account. They cannot see Requests belonging to other Clients.
BR-09
This list strictly displays Requests (pre-contract). Once a Request becomes a "Project" (contract signed), it is moved to the "My Projects" list and removed from this view.
BR-10
User can strictly only view the details of Requests they created or are asigned
BR-11
The available actions on this page are determined by the Request Status state machine. For example, a "Private" request allows "Post to Market," but a "Public" request does not allow "Post to Market" (since it is already there).
BR-12
A Public Request allows open bidding. A Private Request relies on specific invites. To prevent "Ghost Bids" (where a Broker thinks they are in the running for a job that is no longer open to them), the system mandates the rejection of all open public bids when switching to Private.
BR-13
If the Client later makes the request Public again, previously rejected bids do not automatically restore. The Brokers must re-apply.
BR-14
Active "Projects" (contracts signed) cannot use this flow. They are already private by nature of the contract.
BR-15
If a Request has reached the "Accepted" stage (implied verbal agreement or active negotiation), one party cannot unilaterally destroy the record. Hard deletion requires the explicit consent (digital signature/button click) of all "Accepted" parties (Client, Broker, Freelancer).
BR-16
If no candidates are "Accepted," the Client retains full ownership and can hard delete unilaterally.
BR-17
The Broker is the sole role authorized to modify or upload the initial contract structure. The Client and Freelancer can only view and (in subsequent UCs) sign or comment.
BR-18
The contract is strictly confidential and visible only to the specific Client, Broker, and Freelancer involved in this specific Request. It is never public.
BR-19
A Project cannot start until Client + Broker + Freelancer have all electronically signed. No exceptions.
BR-20
Once the 3rd signature is placed, the negotiation phase ends immediately. The System must prevent any further edits to the specifications or budget.
BR-21
The parties can sign in any order (e.g., Client first, or Broker first). The system handles the asynchronous nature of the signatures.
BR-22
Request can only be edited when it is a Draft
BR-23
These specs serve as the "Scope of Work" attachment for the Contract. The Contract cannot be finalized until at least one valid version of Specs exists.
BR-24
Since the specs define the product the Client is paying for, any change (no matter how small) triggers a notification to the Client to ensure transparency.
BR-25
A user cannot serve as both the Broker and the Freelancer on the same Request/Project to prevent self-dealing and conflict of interest.
BR-26
The Broker is the sole party authorized to define the "Definition of Done" (DoD) for milestones. Once the Client approves these specs (UC-98), they become the binding criteria for payment.
BR-27
To prevent platform circumvention, the sharing of external contact information (emails, phone numbers, external links) in Public Requests or Cover Letters is strictly prohibited and subject to automated filtering.
BR-28
A Freelancer shall not be required to start work on a milestone until the Client has deposited 100% of that milestone's value into the Virtual Escrow.
BR-29
Funds held in Escrow can only be released to the Freelancer/Broker after the Client clicks "Approve Milestone" or after the Auto-Approval period (BR-30) expires.
BR-30
If a Freelancer submits a milestone for review and the Client takes no action (neither approves nor disputes) within 14 calendar days, the system will automatically release the funds to the Freelancer.
BR-31
The system must automatically split the Escrow payout based on the contract terms (e.g., 80% to Freelancer, 20% to Broker) at the moment of milestone approval.
BR-32
A Project can only have one "Active" milestone at a time. A subsequent milestone cannot be funded until the previous one is marked as "Completed" or "Cancelled."
BR-33
Only the Freelancer assigned to the project can move items to "In Review" on the Kanban board. The Broker and Client can move items to "Accepted" or "Rejected."
BR-34
Only the Freelancer assigned to the project can move items to "In Review" on the Kanban board. The Broker and Client can move items to "Accepted" or "Rejected."
BR-35
If a user’s account is "Banned" (UC-83), all their Public Requests are hidden, and all active negotiations are paused. However, active Projects (with signed contracts) move into a "Legal Review" state.
BR-36
Users who are currently "Banned" or have "Inactive" KYC status are hidden from this list and cannot be searched or invited.
BR-37
Once a contract is submitted for review, the Technical Specifications are locked and cannot be edited.
BR-38
The list prioritizes "Verified" partners and those with higher completion rates in the search ranking.
BR-39
Users can only view public profile information; private contact details (phone/personal email) are hidden unless a contract is signed.
BR-40
A Client can send a maximum of 10 active pending invitations per Request to prevent spamming.
BR-41
The list should prioritize projects with "Pending Action" (e.g., milestone approval needed) by placing them at the top.
BR-42
Only the Client assigned to this specific project can view this milestone list.
BR-43
Every rejection must be accompanied by text feedback to maintain a project audit trail.
BR-44
: A milestone cannot be approved by the Client until the Broker has first marked it as "Approved" in this review process.
BR-45
Both the Client and the Freelancer must approve the specifications/milestones before they are considered binding.
BR-46
Approving a milestone during the Project phase (scope change) may update the total project budget or timeline.
BR-47
Chat content must pass through a basic filter to prevent harassment or prohibited exchange of external contact info
BR-48
Discussion history is archived and cannot be deleted by the users to ensure a record exists for potential disputes.
BR-49
A Request is removed from this list the moment the contract is fully signed by all three parties (moving it to the Allocated Projects list).
BR-50
Admin data access is restricted to the Admin panel only.
BR-51
Questions must be displayed in the exact numerical order they appear to the Client in the wizard.
BR-52
Answer options are only applicable to selection-based questions; text-input questions will show a "Manual Input" status instead.
BR-53
Editing an answer only affects the display for future users; it does not retroactively change the answers submitted in existing Requests.
BR-54
An answer cannot be deleted if it is the only remaining option for a mandatory multiple-choice question.
